# TETRIS

SIMPLE TEXT MODE BASED TETRIS GAME BY VINCEBUS RIVERUPTUM

>What is this?

This was a little project it started somewhere in late 2017-2018 as a
C programming exercise, using basic IO as the screen and the keyboard, also
an study of game rules and video game development.

For programming, i used Borland C 3.1 on an old 486DX4-100 Machine. If you
want to check it out i'd recommend installing Borland C (I'm pretty sure
Turbo C will work fine BTW) on Dosbox, just open tetris.c on the IDE
then compile it and done.

>How to play?

It doesn't use the arrow keys yet, but WASD for the piece movement, SPACE
for rotation and CTRL+PAUSE to exit the application.


>Any future improvements?

Yes, i'd like to add some sound effects, maybe in the future also real GFX
using mode 13h or CGA/EGA modes along with sprites, scrolling, dunno... This
project got abandonned because last year got little interest on retro
programming, but this year(late 2022) went back again, programming in general
because i was busy working on different projects.
